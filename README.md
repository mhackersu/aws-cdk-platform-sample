# Sample AWS Platform with CDK

Completed:

- [x] CDK Bootstrap & Init
- [x] [Infra Strategy](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript/ecs/fargate-service-with-local-image) (Fargate, ECS)
- [x] Project Refinements (Organizing code blocks)

Next steps
- [ ] [Docker Image Build](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/building-container-images-on-amazon-ecs-on-aws-fargate/) (Might lean here to use an hosted build agent for reasons related to signed provenance.)
